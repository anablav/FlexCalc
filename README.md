## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `src/main/java/com/example/flexcalc/FlexcalcApplication.java` class from your IDE.
Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Running unit tests
